| 1 | **Orchestrator Manager** | `EMPATHFLOW.md` | Preflight, phase order, mediate, report ship |
| 1b | **Persona Managers (×N)** | `docs/personas.md` | One per persona — advocate, negotiate priority, veto harm |
| 2 | **Product Analyst** | Codebase | Purpose, features, promised vs shipped |
| 3 | **Empathy Mapper** | EmpathFlow | Draft/quality of maps; seats with Persona Managers |
| 4 | **Journey Critic** | EmpathFlow | Flows for **all** in-scope personas |
| 5 | **Heuristic Auditor** | `playbook.md` | Hard gates |
| 6 | **Design System Checker** | `web/DESIGN.md` | Tokens / system vs shipped UI |

### TasteTest default Persona Managers

| Seat | Persona | Non-negotiable if secondary |
|------|---------|------------------------------|
| **PM-Avery** | Avery (founder) | Obvious install; report clear in minutes |
| **PM-Jordan** | Jordan (eng) | Real init / OSS credibility |
| **PM-Sam** | Sam (designer) | Sample looks serious, not a toy |

## Phase order (Orchestrator enforces)

```
0. Preflight
   ├─ Intent + preserve list
   ├─ Personas exist?
   ├─ Seat Persona Managers (PM-*)
   └─ Priority council → Priority / Secondary / Deferred
         │
         GO
         ▼
1–2. Product + maps
         ▼
3. Journeys (all in-scope PMs; weight priority)
         ▼
4. Critique (priority first + secondary harm pass)
         ▼
5. Frontend Design **asks** Orchestrator + all PMs for visual prefs (design brief)
   then library search · Craft · Motion · Prose · Design System
   (multi-persona impact on each proposal)
         ▼
6. Report
         ▼
7. Consensus log → implement only if Approves met
```

**Frontend Design cannot invent taste.** No ui-ux-pro-max search or redesign until managers answer the brief (`FRONTEND.md` Step 0) **and** project `DESIGN.md` is loaded when marketing/`web/` is in scope (Step 0b).

### Priority council (not single-persona tunnel vision)

1. Each **Persona Manager** pitches for priority **this run**.  
2. Council sets **Priority** + **Secondary non-negotiables**.  
3. Later work must check: help priority? **hurt secondary?** → that PM must Approve.  
4. File “primary” is a **proposal**, re-negotiated each full run.

### Blocking

| Missing | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Personas | **NO-GO** |
| Priority never negotiated (full run) | **NO-GO** |
| Design brief unanswered (full UI work) | Frontend **BLOCKED** — no library/search/redesign |
| Implement without Approves | **BLOCK** |
| Harm secondary without PM Approve | **Persona coverage: weak** |

### Homepage / marketing redesign Approves

Orchestrator · **all Persona Managers** · Journey · Craft · Motion  
(+ Prose if copy-heavy). Frontend proposes only.

## Talk + consensus

Handoffs and consensus templates: **`COLLABORATION.md`**.

Before implement, always include **multi-persona impact**.
